 * `wasi:thread_spawn` is supposed to "instantiate the module again".
 * Unfortunately it isn't always obvious which module it is, especially
 * when multiple modules are involved. In this implementation, an embedder
 * needs to specify it explicitly via this api.
 * Also, this api takes the parameters for the re-instantiation.
 * (import_object here)
